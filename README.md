# Coin-Compare
A website for searching for and comparing cryptocurrencies!

### Developers Note

Coin-Compare works best in the Chrome web browser. 

## General Info

Coin-Compare was created to help potential investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike by providing clear comparisons for information about coins they are interested on-demand. Coin-Compare not only allows users to search for individual coins - it also allows the user to gain a wholistic market view of cryptocurrencies by displaying rank, market capitalization, 7-day change, and 24-hour volume. Users are able to evaluate specific currencies of their choosing against market leaders such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) through a dynamically-generated chart.
